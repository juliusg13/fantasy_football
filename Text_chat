Much better than watsapp, So this is for the:
stofna nýtt borð

'table name'     should change for     ''choose games '' 
                                          it will open the 'calendary' with games. 
                                          (the player will choose 5 games + 2 games tide breakers) 
                                        
                                        
'player 5 to 10'   should change for   (Private or Public)
                                       -Private 'open next page with 2 buttons' 
                                                -text 'Envite friends via sms' 
                                                - button 'back' to create table
Place bet 
...


For the 'tengjast örðru borði'

There will be from 12 to 15 randoms tables to choose from.
67% os the tables will be closed 'red'  with 10/10 players
23% of the tables will be open 'green' from 6/10 players
10% of the tables will be 'Yellow' from 1/10 to 5/10 players

there will be 2 buttons 'more' & 'back' 




---------------------
I need some UI designs. 
I need a button that says PUBLIC, and the other PRIVATE. 
neutral color buttons with this text:  PUBLIC,   (blue background white with letters)
and sexy red, yellow or white or something version of the text: PRIVATE

----------------
Also i need a button that is just like the "Button_ChooseAGAme" with the text "Invite friends with SMS"
----------------
Button that says Create, or ADD table you know, upgrade graphics in style to other in this scene.
